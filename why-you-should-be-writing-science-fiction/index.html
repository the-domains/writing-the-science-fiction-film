of good reasons why you should be writing science fiction. I’ll start with the
obvious one – money - because no other genre can match science fiction at the
box office. Take a look at the <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2014&p=.htm">worldwide grosses for 2014</a>, 11 of
the top 20 are science fiction (and 3 are fantasy, just saying…) so while it
may jar with your art-house sensibilities, if you want get a producer excited,
then a great high-concept, science fiction story will appeal to that basest of
instincts – profit.</p><p>But of course
there’s a lot more to science fiction than that.</p><picture>

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Is It Sci-Fi For The Right Reasons?</b></p><p>Good science
fiction isn't all alien invasions, giant lizards or post-apocalyptic cannibals,
and there's a reason why science-fiction is known as 'the genre of ideas', it's
because great science fiction asks big "What if..?" questions, the
kind of questions that allow us to examine the day-to-day realities of this world
by exploring the different realities of worlds we create. Science fiction lets
us examine core social and societal issues and pose difficult and searching
questions about subjects that concern all of us - pollution, over-reliance on
technology, globalisation, genetic engineering, personal data, global pandemic,
overpopulation, government surveillance – the list is endless, but it lets us do
it without pointing directly at any individual or group, any particular
religion or country, any specific corporation or government.</p><p>Science fiction
allows us to shine a spotlight on something, bring it to the attention of the
world and say, "<i>Look at this! Look
what is happening! Look what they've done!</i>", without preaching, and
this is especially true if that something is out of our control or something we
cannot easily change.</p><p>So the key to
writing good science fiction is to <u>have something to say</u>. Don't just use
it as an excuse to have giant fighting robots level an entire city. You can do
that if you want, but do it for the right reasons.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Are You Really Writing a Sci-Fi?</b></p><p>The next
question to ask yourself is are you using science fiction as a genre or just a
setting? Unlike other genres, science-fiction comes in all shapes and sizes.
Romantic comedies are romantic and funny, horror films are horrifying, dramas
are dramatic, and thrillers are thrilling. Science fiction can be all of those
things <i>and </i>be science-fictional. Look at some examples:</p><p>• About Time - is a romance <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• Alien - is a horror movie <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• ET - is a family adventure <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• Terminator - is an action movie <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• Never Let Me Go - is a drama <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• Total Recall - is a thriller <b>and </b>a science fiction film</p><p>• Sleeper - is a comedy <b>and </b>a
science fiction film</p><p>Every genre
has its particular story beats and you will save yourself a whole lot of grief
and aggravation if you figure out your primary genre and then write to the
beats of that genre first. So if you're writing a science fiction revenge
thriller then I would suggest that you actually plot a decent revenge thriller
first, then as you re-write, build up the science fiction elements slowly,
revealing your world through action and character rather than trying to build a
‘cool’ sci-fi world and then shoe-horning a revenge thriller plot into it.
You'll be rewarded with a far better screenplay if you do it that way, believe
me.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Have You Thought
Your Sci-Fi World Through?</b></p><picture>

<p>Building a unique
world for your characters, putting all the great stuff that's been in your head
on the page, is the most fun you can have while writing. But effective
world-building requires the right level of detail to make it work visually, and
well thought out, well-connected elements for it to make sense.</p><p>Arguably the two
most important world-building elements in any science fiction setting are time
and space, but by 'time' I don't mean when your story is set, I mean the
social/cultural stage that your world has reached, and by extension when I say ‘space’
I don’t mean the cosmos, I mean the kind of space that your characters inhabit.
There are five world stages:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>First Stage World</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The time of primitive,
nomadic peoples with few tools, living in basic dwellings, hunting and
gathering to survive.</p><p><i>Second Stage
World</i></p><p>The time of settled
villages and small towns with permanent houses. Hunting and gathering is supplemented
by farming. Taxation means law and order is established.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Third Stage
World</i></p><p>The City. Small
purpose-built housing means less space but new technology brings new
opportunities. People now have leisure time and luxury goods, but there is also
crime.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Fourth Stage
World</i></p><p>The oppressive,
dystopian world of our nightmares. The city is vast. People pay high prices to live
in tiny spaces. Unemployment, poverty and crime are rife. Taxes are high but
government services are poor, inefficient and corrupt.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Fifth Stage
World</i></p><p>The dying world.
The environment destroyed, natural resources depleted, and air and water polluted
beyond recovery. Food is scarce, disease is rife. Eventually humans will die
out, leaving a quiet and desolate planet in their wake.</p><picture>

<p>Whether your
story takes place on a newly discovered planet or in London of 1830, the
relationship that your characters have to where they live and the tools and
technology that surround them will be critical in building your world. Good
science fiction rarely sits squarely within a single world stage, more likely
it will sit at a point of change between two of the stages, exploring the
effect that giant social and cultural change has on the characters as well and on
society at large.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Get the science
as right as necessary </b></p><p>The science
always matters - even if it’s totally made up - but it really matters when
you’re depicting things the audience know about. If someone describes a
scientific principal, don’t ‘think’ you know it, make sure you know it, and
then double-check with someone who does know it to make sure you understood it.
And scientific thinking changes regularly with new findings, so make sure
you’re up-to-date.</p><p>Basing your sci-fi
worlds on the real world principals grounds them and makes them seem authentic,
but this means knowing a little of what you’re talking about. In the same way
that you should understand human and animal physiology when creating alien
creatures, you should understand other sciences, arts, skills and trades to
successfully create your own versions. If you’re going to have huge buildings
then you should understand architectural principles so that you get the scale
and proportions right. If you’re going to invent a language then you need to
know about lexicons, morphology and syntax. The same goes for your systems of
law, banking and commerce, and knowing proper military tactics will lend your
armies a credible air of invincibility.</p><p>You don't need
to be an expert, just learn enough so that you can write about it convincingly,
but above all, be consistent. It doesn’t matter if the physics of your world
aren’t real as long as they are consistent and you never break your own rules.
If it helps, draw maps and pictures, construct mythologies around your world
and its inhabitants - whatever it takes to immerse yourself in your world.
There’s a good chance that none of it will make it into your screenplay, but if
they’re clear in your own mind it will make your descriptions come alive.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Put down the
thesaurus and step away from the dialogue</b></p><p>Jargon and sci-fi
go hand-in-hand. Anytime you discuss new technology or scientific principles,
complex processes or advanced systems, inevitably the folk that work with them
will develop acronyms, technical references and slang that only they will
understand. What writers of science fiction must avoid is baffling, nonsensical,
faux-technology. If you’re ever tempted to write a line like “<i>They’ve re-interpolated the quantum field
transmission data and reverse-engineered the resulting Heisenberg matrix to
calculate our vector</i>”, just remember that “<i>They’ve found us!</i>” is a much better line. It’s easier to say,
easier to remember, has much greater impact and makes sense to everyone who
hears it.</p><p>It’s also worth
remembering that sci-fi names can be a source of much comedy if you’re not
careful. Ixnys Zyxiz may look great on the page but if the reader can’t read it
they’ll dump your script in the trash before they get 10 pages in, besides, it’s
difficult to take anyone seriously when their name is Ambassador Zorax.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Write something
that can be made!</b></p><p>Interstellar space travel and alien creatures usually require
vast battalions of sfx people and multi-million dollar budgets to realise, so unless
you're Christopher Nolan or best mates with Will Smith, do yourself a favour
and look for the small stories, the ones in single locations, with few actors,
no special effects and write those. Explore social issues here on Earth,
extrapolate from current technologies in medicine and genetics and find stories
there. Explore the big-impact issues that affect all of us - often they're the
stories that are the most interesting, and more importantly, more likely to get
made, and isn't that why we write screenplays in the first place?</p><p><i>Robert Grant is a
